# Specification Quality Checklist: Player Entity with Admin CRUD and Public Profile Page (MVP)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All user stories are independently testable (P1-P3 priorities assigned)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (time-based metrics, percentages, counts)
- Edge cases are identified and documented (7 edge cases covering validation, concurrency, errors)
- Dependencies and out-of-scope items are clearly defined
- Position field format (enum vs free-text) is documented in assumptions as to be clarified during implementation - acceptable for MVP
